Recurring Tickets

With templates, it is possible to program the opening of tickets on a
recurring basis.

Open a ticket every Friday morning to make a tape backup at night same.
Make an initialization operation all early months.

This feature is accessible from the menu Assistance \> Recurrent Tickets
.

A recurrent ticket includes a *gabarit*, that will be used as a model
for the tickets, and a *beginning date* and an *opening frequency*. The
process can be triggered *early*. Finally, it is possible to
*deactivate* the recurring ticket with the parameter *active*. A
calendar can also be associated in order to limit ticket's creation to
working days. If the ticket's creation had planned a weekend for example
it will be postponed to Monday.

Note: tickets will only be created if the recurrent ticket is active
during the defined period between the start date and end date. The end
date is optionnal but the begin date is mandatory.

The opening of recurring tickets is made through an automatic action
named *ticketrecurrent* (see [Configurer les actions
automatiques](config_crontask.html "Les actions automatiques se configurent depuis le menu Configuration > Actions automatiques")).
