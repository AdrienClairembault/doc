Viiew and manage records

The display of all recordings and all details of a record in always
listed the same way in GLPI. Whether it's a list of computers,
telephones or tickets, the presentation follows the same principle.

A list of items can be obtained in two ways: from the search engine or
from another list.

From the search engine, after determining the criteria and validated
research, a list of records is displayed. By default no search criteria
does not limit the list of records available and the display is first n
limited to the list.

From the menu Assets \> Computers : If any search criterion is
determined, the first n computers of the list will be posted.

From a list, a new list can be obtained.

From a computer list: click on the name of a computer; navigate tab
software. The list of software installed on this computer is displayed.

Record details that are of similar information are grouped by and
displayed in tabs.

To a computer, financial information and a list of software is in two
tabs distinct.
