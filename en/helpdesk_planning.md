View and manage schedules
=========================

Schedules are managed from the menu Assistance \> Planning

Planning allows the user to view scheduled tasks for a ticket or a
problem and also scheduled reminders or scheduled items fro plugins.

You can choose the date and time for viewing. Filtering the objects
included in the schedule is also possible.

4 views are availables depending of rights of the user:

-   Personal view: only the items of the current user
-   View group: only the items of the groups of the current user
    (requires the right to see the schedule of people in my groups)
-   Users: You can view the schedule for a specific user (requires the
    right to see all plannings)
-   Groups: You can see the schedule of a specific group (requires the
    right to see all schedules)

This information is exported in two formats:

-   Ical in order to integrate the calendar with third-party software
-   Webcal "protocol" that allows to subscribe a calendar to a third
    party software on the GLPI planning

Note: Access to the Ical and Webcal protocol is protected by a security
key integrated into the URL. It is possible to regenerate this key from
the "Preferences" menu. See [Managing user
preferences](start_pref.html "User preferences are changing from the menu Settings")
and more precisely [Personalize the
interface](config_common_personalize.html "Display preferences that can be set with default values and that users can change for their session are grouped in tab Personalization.").

Note: Notes are also displayed in planning.
