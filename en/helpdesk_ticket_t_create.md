Create a ticket
===============

To begin, the requester must express a need. For that there are several
tools to choose from :

-   The requester fills an online form
-   The requester contacts an operator directly (or by telephone) who
    then transcribes the statement
-   The requester sends the incident report by email (see
    [Receivers](helpdesk_advanced_collectors.html "Receivers")).

Note: In advanced use, it is also possible to create recurring tickets
(see [Recurring
Tickets](helpdesk_advanced_recurrent.html "Recurring Tickets")).

Create a ticket in the standard interface :

1.  Log into GLPI
2.  Go to the menu Assistance \> Tickets
3.  Click on the icon ![image](../image/menu_add.png) located in the
    horizontal menu
4.  Complete the various fields of the blank form
5.  Add \

Display the created form.
