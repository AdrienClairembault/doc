Ticket Categories
=================

Ticket Categories

A ticket can be categorized to facilitate processing. Depending on the
desired configuration, the Requester may include a category, and the
technician could change it.

It is important when setting up the Helpdesk to think through the list
of available categories. Too many visible to users can disrupt the
incident information, whereas too few does not correctly characterize
the request.

Category management is accessible from the menu headings: Setup \>
Dropdowns \> Categories of tickets

A class may be invisible in the simplied interface (to reduce the list
of categories presented to end users). It may also be visible or not for
incidents, requests or problems.

The tickets categories are one of elements for the automatic treatments
after the creation of a ticket (see [Règles métier pour les
tickets](administration_rule_ticket.html "Lors de la création d'un ticket, un mécanisme permet de modifier les attributs du ticket de manière automatique.")).
