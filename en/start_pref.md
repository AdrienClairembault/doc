Managing user preferences
=========================

User preferences are changing from the menu Settings

Each authenticated user has the ability to change their preferences.

The Settings menu is at the top and right of the interface, from any
page.

Main Tab
--------

Users can edit personal information here: First name, Surname, Email
addresses, phone numbers, location and language.

Note: Some fields are not editable if they come from an LDAP directory.

The user can add email addresses and select the default address, which
will be used for sending notifications.

The user may also specify certain default behaviors of the application,
such as the profile and the default select entity when connecting to the
interface (see [Manage user's
profiles](administration_profile.html "In GLPI, profiles are managed from the menu Administration > Profiles.")
and [Administrer les
entités](administration_entity.html "Dans GLPI, administrer les entités peut se faire à partir du menu Administration > Entités.")).
He can also disable notifications for the actions it performs.

The experienced user may also choose to exit the normal mode of the
application:

-   In debug mode, GLPI displays errors, all values of variables, SQL
    queries, etc. It is useful to enable this mode in case of GLPI
    malfunction. Thus much information can be communicated to the
    developers of the GLPI project. This mode also allows to have
    information additional on various objects in a specific tab
    (notifications, etc.).

Personal View tab
-----------------

This tab allows you to reset the display customization of the various
lists. The user can, for each type of object, return to the default
display by removing this customization (see [Viewing
Records](navigate_manageitem.html "Viiew and manage records")).

-   **[Personalize the
    interface](../glpi/config_common_personalize.html)**\
     Display preferences that can be set with default values and that
    users can change for their session are grouped in tab
    Personalization.
