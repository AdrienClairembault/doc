Budget management
=================

Budgets are managed via menu Management \> Budgets

A budget is made of a certain amount of fields: a **name**, a **value**,
a period of time in which the budget has been allocated, defined by a
**start date** and a **end date**.

The budget must be defined in the financial and administrative
information of inventory items.

It can be also defined over several entities (recursivity).

A budget summary grouped by inventory item types is shown (total spent
per par type, total remaining).

Note: when viewing sub-entity budget, total remaining budget is not
accessible.

Important: this total is be negative when total value of inventory item
is greater than budget value.

Note: templates can be defined for budgets (see [Manage
Templates](template.html "Manage templates in GLPI")).
