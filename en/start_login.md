Log into GLPI
=============

How to connect to GLPI ?

Start the browser and go to the GLPI home page
[http://<GLPI\_ADDRESS\>](http://<ADRESSE_GLPI>). Access to the
application features requires authentication. Based on the profile of
the authenticated user, the interface displayed is either standard
interface or simplified interface (see [The standard interface and
simplified
interface](navigate_interface.html "According to its clearance, the user uses the standard interface or the simplified interface.")).

An unauthenticated user can access certain features if GLPI has been
configured to allow: view the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), open a
ticket, etc. (see [Onglet
Assistance](config_common_assist.html "Cet onglet permet de param√©trer le comportement de la partie assistance de GLPI.")).
