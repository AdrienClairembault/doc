Change the priority rules
=========================

Configure the matrix to set priorities based on urgency and impact: to
limit levels of emergency and availability.

The ticket processing order by technicians is based on the ticket
priority. This is calculated based the urgency and user-defined impact
on the IT department.

GLPI has a matrix, overall to the whole application, which can be
displayed and modified in the menu Setup \> General \> Assistance.

It is also possible to restrict the levels of urgency and priority used
in the application, for example the declaration and qualification of
tickets.

Note: priority **Major** is not part of the matrix. This is superior to
others, and requires the right to change the priority order to assign
it. Represents a major incident ticket whose treatment is so important
that it overrides all others.
