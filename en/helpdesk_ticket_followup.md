Follow-ups

Ticket follow-ups, and use characteristics

**Followups** is the default tab when viewing a ticket, unless it is
awaiting approval from a solution. It allows adding information to an
existing ticket, for example, note that the requester is reminded that
the ticket is awaiting the availability of the requester. This is the
component that facilitates communication between the requester and
persons in charge of his ticket.

To add a followup, click **Add a new follow-up** and enter a
description.

You can choose the source of the follow-up (see [Configurer les
intitulés](config_dropdown.html "Les intitulés se configurent depuis le menu Configuration > Intitulés")).

Followups may be private or public. Private followups are only visible
for users with the right
`View all follow-ups and tasks (public and private)` in their profile.
This allows, for example, an exchange between technicians without the
requester being able to see it.

The user can update followups where they are not the author if they have
the right `Update all followups`. Users can delete followups if they
have the right `Delete all followups` (see [Manage user's
profiles](administration_profile.html "In GLPI, profiles are managed from the menu Administration > Profiles.").
