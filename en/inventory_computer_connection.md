Direct Connections
==================

Computer direct connection management

Direct connections represent the relationship between different hardware
connected physically or virtually. For each object type connected, the
name, serial number, inventory number are listed. A link allows to
indicate to GLPI that this object should no longer be marked as
connected to the computer.

Example : Connecting a computer with a printer (network or not), a
monitor, a device or an external phone.

Connections or disconnections are made from the details of all related
materials or from the massive update system.
