===============

Reports on tickets are available from the menu Assistance \> Statistics

You can view statistics according to a configurable period :

-   **Global :**

    Displays statistics about the tickets :

    -   Number of tickets opened, resolved, closed and resolved late
    -   Number of open satisfaction surveys, number of responses to
        surveys and average level of satisfaction
    -   The average time for consideration, resolution and closure of
        the ticket
    -   The average actual duration of treatment of the ticket

-   **Per ticket :**

    Displays statistics about the elements of the tickets, selected via
    a drop down menu. For example: requester, assigned technician,
    impact, etc. ...

    The results have the following elements :

    -   Number of tickets opened, resolved, closed and resolved late
    -   Number of open satisfaction surveys, number of responses to
        surveys and average level of satisfaction
    -   Average time for assignment of the ticket :

        (Time between the opening of the ticket and the first action on
        it (monitoring, task or solution)

    -   Average time to resolution and closure of the ticket
    -   Real average and total duration of treatment of the ticket

        Actual duration of the interventions scheduled by people who
        take care of the tickets. "(real) Duration of ticket" means the
        time spent by a technician on the tasks related to tickets.

-   **By title :**

    Displays statistics about the components of computers. For example:
    Model, Operating System, model of motherboard, etc. ...

    The statistical elements obtained are the same as for statistics on
    the tickets.

-   **Per item :**

    Displays the number of tickets allocated to each item, sorted by
    number of tickets.

For each line of output, the icon ![image](../image/stats_item.png)
allows a graphical view of these statistics

The option **See charts**, when present, displays the results as a
distribution pie chart.

Note: When statistics are performed on an element tree (or groups
categories, for example), two presentations are available. Normal: all
values are displayed. Tree: only the values are displayed at the same
level and take into account the values attached to tickets children; you
can then navigate the tree values.
