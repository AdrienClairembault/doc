Links between tickets
=====================

Relations between the tickets: link and duplication

Links between tickets can be defined. These can be two types :

-   *Linked to* : is only a single bond that has only informational
    purposes.
-   *Duplicates* : This is a duplicate ticket. A resolution of a ticket,
    the same solution is set to the Duplicate tickets (which are
    automatically resolved).
