Ticket Priority
===============

Ticket Priority

The ticket priority is based on information provided by the requester
and the technician :

-   The requester defines the urgency
-   The technician evaluates the impact
-   Priority is the result of these two variables. It is calculated
    automatically via a matrix and indicates the real significance of
    the ticket.

Note: For the configuration of this matrix, see [Change the priority
rules](helpdesk_advanced_ordering.html "Configure the matrix to set priorities based on urgency and impact: to limit levels of emergency and availability.").
