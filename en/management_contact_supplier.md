Link contacts and suppliers
===========================

The difference is clearly established between a supplier, which is
possible to link in a one-to-one relation with inventory elements, and
between contacts, which composes person list allowing relationship with
this supplier. To feed this list, contacts must be linked to the
concerned supplier.

structure is getting goods on a regular basis. Create a supplier called
Acme. Create a contact named Mister Smith. Assign to this contact the
sales representative. And link this contact to supplier Acme.
