Exploring the GLPI interface
============================

Depending on the user's profile, menus may be different but the logic of
the interface remains the same.

GLPI's interface consists of five areas involving the application
functionality based on their nature.

1.  The user menu allows you to manage preferences, access help and
    logout
2.  The main menu lets you navigate through the different modules
3.  The breadcrumb navigation provides some context for using the main
    work area
4.  The entity selector menu lets you interact with the entity context
5.  The main work area is the preferred region for interaction with the
    application
