Les statuts

ITIL defines the status lifecycle of a ticket. This lifecycle is
implemented as follows in GLPI :

-   New
-   Pending
-   Processing (assigned)
-   Processing (planned)
-   Solved
-   Closed

These statutes are neither definable or changeable.

Note: We can nevertheless hide certain statutes in the general
configuration of helpdesk (see the setup [Onglet
Assistance](config_common_assist.html "Cet onglet permet de param√©trer le comportement de la partie assistance de GLPI.")
tab).

Note: To go further in status management, see
[Receivers](helpdesk_advanced_collectors.html "Receivers"), [Ticket
Templates](helpdesk_advanced_templates.html "Ticket Templates") and
[Business rules change and allocation of
tickets](helpdesk_advanced_businessrules.html "Business rules change and allocation of tickets").
