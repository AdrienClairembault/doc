Satisfaction
============

The result of the satisfaction survey of a ticket, characteristics and
use

At the close of a ticket, a customer satisfaction survey can be sent to
applicants. The sending frequency and trigger after ticket closure is
defined per entity (see [Déléguer l'administration par
entité](administration_entity_delegation.html "Délégation de certains paramètres d'administration par entité")).

If email notifications are enabled (see [Configure follow-up emails and
alerts](config_notification_configuration.html "The general configuration of notifications is done from the menu Setup > Notifications > Email followups configuration.")),
a notification is sent asking them to respond to the survey. Otherwise,
requesters will have access to the surveys after the page of the ticket.

The requester may then define the degree of satisfaction (0 to 5) on the
resolution of his ticket. They can also comment if they wish.

Statistics on investigations are available in
[statistiques](helpdesk_stat.dita).

Note: A requester may amend their answer to the satisfaction survey in a
within 12h after the first response.

Note: A notification may be send when a satisfaction survey is answered.
