The GLPI Assistance help desk

The assistance module allows users to capture, monitor and process
tickets. Statistics are also available.

In order to initiate a help desk, several steps are necessary. To begin,
analyze the basic needs of users and meet the minimum level of support.

Once basic needs are satisfied, it is possible to define secondary needs
and engage in the advanced configuration.

The assistance module of GLPI is consistent with ITIL best practices
guide and therefore incorporates the concepts and standardized fields.
Although this tool complies with ITIL, there is no obligation to follow
these best practices: everyone is free to implement the assistance help
desk to best fits their needs.
