Problem Management
==================

Problem Management

A problem is the cause of one or more incidents and can usually be
identified because one or more incidents have the same symptoms.

Creating a problem can be done either from the ticket of an incident in
the tab *Problems*, or directly from the menu Assistance \> Problems

The creation of a problem similar to the incident, shares the concepts
(*Requester*, *Watcher*, *Assigned*, *Status*, *Urgency*, *Impact*,
*Priority*, *Category*, for details see [Manage
tickets](helpdesk_ticket.html "Tickets in GLPI, characteristics and use")).

Once the problem is created, it is possible to attach incidents (tab
*Tickets*) and materials impacted (tab *Items*). An analysis phase (tab
*Analysis*) is to describe the impacts, causes and symptoms thereof in
order to achieve a solution.

Note: From the list of tickets, a workaround can be associated to all
related tickets without solving the problem.

Like tickets, [task
management](helpdesk_ticket_task.html "Ticket tasks, characteristics and use")
, [costs](helpdesk_advanced_cost.html "Les coûts liés") and the addition
of a
[solution](helpdesk_ticket_solution.html "Solution of a ticket, characteristics and use")
can track and resolve the problem.

Problems using their own notifications..

Similar to tickets, Stats are available for problems (see [View
Statistics](helpdesk_stat.html "Reports on tickets are available from the menu Assistance > Statistics")
)
